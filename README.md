# 100-Days-of-Code-Python

100 days of code in Python, by Angela Yu

I've took the opportunity at the very start of New year to embark on a journey of learning programming. The choice fell on Python and most recommended course was one of Angela Yu called simply "100 days of code - The complete Python pro bootcamp". Not planning to spam my journey here on GitHub, I'll just put files after doing each day final project. Journey itself would be explained on a blog that I plan to start. Hopefully, you'll find it both educational and amusing.
